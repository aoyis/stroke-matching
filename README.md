Abstract: 
*Stroke matching of handwritten Chinese characters plays a crucial role in a wide range of applications, including Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and cultural preservations. While having such importance, difficulties are often faced due to several factors: complex structures and combinations of stroke, individual writing style and ambiguity. With digital image processing algorithms advancing over time, the focus of this specific task has been shifted to gaining improvement in stability and robustness. Despite already having promising and advanced deep learning-based methods, many prefer a more traditional approach in the field of handwritten characters matching under consideration of various constraints and drawbacks. In this research work, we propose a stroke matching method featuring stroke extraction using contour information for handwritten Chinese characters. By having boundary points, corner points and segments information, cross sections in between opposite segments are established and stroke structures are validated. Next, the matching between input and standard characters is carried out using position, ratio, directional information and regional maps. With this proposed algorithm, we are able to quantify and measure the similarities of input handwritten Chinese characters to a set of ground truth characters in order to find corresponding stroke matches, even if the size and resolution of the input images may fluctuate.*
